# 3goodthingsdiary
A project for Mobile Networks and Applcation Development class.

In this project we had to create an app for the following idea: http://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/three-good-things#.

It's actually a diary where you write 3 good things a day. 

It uses a database to store the entries.
